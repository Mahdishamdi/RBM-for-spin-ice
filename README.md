Overview

This project implements a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using TensorFlow v1 to learn a pattern from an input dataset. The code generates a structured binary dataset, trains the RBM using contrastive divergence, and visualizes the training errors and reconstructed outputs.

Features

Creates a patterned dataset using NumPy

Implements a basic RBM with sigmoid activations and Gibbs sampling

Uses contrastive divergence for training

Tracks reconstruction errors over epochs

Visualizes input, intermediate, and reconstructed outputs
